# KenshiSmoothXP
DLL plugin mod with changes to the way XP gain works in Kenshi:
- [Stochastic rounding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rounding#Stochastic_rounding) is used to allow slow XP gain at high levels, rather than the gained XP always rounding down to 0.
- Custom [level multiplier curve](https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenshi/comments/1hisvzq/kenshi_fact_of_the_day_11/) allows for (very slow) XP gain past level 101.
